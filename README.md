# URLProxy
## Author: Kareem T | Date: 11/13/2023

URLProxy minimally extends the requests' module 'get' method functionality by randomizing proxies on web-requests; this includes a refresh feature that will automatically rotate a new proxy and retry in the case one proxy connection/web request fails.

**The goal:** Automate a tedious process many encounter & deal with during their web-scraping & data gathering.
